            <p>Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence that leverages data and algorithms to enable computers to learn from and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It's a powerful technology with a wide range of applications across various industries.</p>
            <p>Here are some key aspects of machine learning:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Machine learning updates traditional HTML elements, applying opinionated styles using element selectors. We also provide additional styling using classes to enhance the user experience.</li>
                <li>Machine learning involves updating default values to use <code>rem</code>s for scalable component spacing, making it easier to adapt to different device sizes.</li>
                <li>Vertical margins are avoided in machine learning, as they can collapse and lead to unexpected results. A single direction of margin simplifies the layout.</li>
                <li>Machine learning uses <code>rem</code>s for margins in block elements for more consistent scaling across device sizes.</li>
                <li>We keep <code>font</code>-related properties to a minimum, utilizing <code>inherit</code> when possible for a more streamlined styling approach.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="css-variables">Machine Learning and Customization <a class="anchor-link" href="#css-variables" aria-label="Link to this section: Machine Learning and Customization"></a></h2>
            <small class="d-inline-flex mb-3 px-2 py-1 fw-semibold text-success bg-success bg-opacity-10 border border-success border-opacity-10 rounded-2">Machine Learning Customization</small>
            
            <p>Machine learning introduces CSS variables to provide real-time customization without the need for extensive recompilation. This enables you to modify styles dynamically, offering a more flexible and user-friendly experience.</p>
            <p>For instance, machine learning incorporates <code>:root</code> CSS variables for various styling aspects:</p>
